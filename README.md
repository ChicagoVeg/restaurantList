This version of the app is scheduled to be retired and uses old JavaScript ideas. Look out for a newer version. 

This is the source code for the ChicagoVeg Group restaurant application. 



The url for this application is: http://www.chicagoveg.com/

Google Map is used and it does not support IE 8 and lower. So, supported browsers are IE 9 and above, Chrome, Safari, Opera. 

This page is the desktop version. A mobile version is forthcoming.
